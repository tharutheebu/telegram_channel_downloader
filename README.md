## üìã Requirements

- API credentials from Telegram

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Step 1: Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install telethon
```

### Step 2: Get Telegram API Credentials

1. Visit https://my.telegram.org
2. Log in with your phone number
3. Click on **"API development tools"**
4. Fill in the application form:
   - App title: e.g., "Channel Downloader"
   - Short name: e.g., "downloader"
   - Platform: Desktop
5. You'll receive:
   - **api_id** (number like: 12345678)
   - **api_hash** (string like: "abcdef1234567890...")

### Step 3: Find Your Channel ID

First, you need to find the ID of the channel you want to download from.

**Run the channel finder:**

```bash
python get_channel_id.py
```

**Before running**, edit `get_channel_id.py` and add your API credentials:

```python
API_ID = 12345678  # Your api_id
API_HASH = 'your_api_hash_here'  # Your api_hash
```

This will list all channels you're a member of with their IDs.

**Example output:**
```
üìã YOUR TELEGRAM CHANNELS

1. My Private Channel
   ID: 3089670048
   Username: No username (Private)
   Type: Private Channel
   Members: 133

2. Tech News
   ID: -1009876543210
   Username: @technews
   Type: Public Channel
   Members: 5000
```

Copy the **ID** of the channel you want to download.

### Step 4: Configure the Downloader

Edit `telegram_downloader.py` and update the configuration:

```python
# Required settings
API_ID = 12345678  # Your api_id from my.telegram.org
API_HASH = 'your_api_hash_here'  # Your api_hash

# Channel to download (use the ID from step 3)
CHANNEL_USERNAME = 3089670048  # For private channels, use the numeric ID
# or for public channels:
# CHANNEL_USERNAME = '@channelname'  # Use @username
# or use invite link:
# CHANNEL_USERNAME = 'https://t.me/+AbCdEfGhIjK'

# Download preferences
DOWNLOAD_VIDEOS = True
DOWNLOAD_PHOTOS = True
DOWNLOAD_DOCUMENTS = True
DOWNLOAD_AUDIO = True

# Optional settings
MAX_MESSAGES = None  # None = all messages, or set a number like 100
DOWNLOAD_FOLDER = 'downloads'  # Where to save files
```

### Step 5: Run the Downloader

```bash
python telegram_downloader.py
```

**First time only:**
- Enter your phone number with country code (e.g., `+919876543210`)
- Enter the verification code sent to your Telegram app
- A session file will be created for future use

## üìÅ Output Structure

Files are organized in folders:

‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ audio/           # All audio files
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ metadata/        # Message metadata as JSON
```

**Filename format:** `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_msgID.extension`

Example: `20241005_143022_msg123.mp4`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Download Settings

```python
DOWNLOAD_VIDEOS = True      # Download video files
DOWNLOAD_PHOTOS = True      # Download photo files
DOWNLOAD_DOCUMENTS = True   # Download document files
DOWNLOAD_AUDIO = True       # Download audio files
```

### Advanced Settings

```python
MAX_MESSAGES = None         # Limit number of messages (None = all)
RESUME_FROM_MESSAGE_ID = None  # Resume from specific message ID
SAVE_METADATA = True        # Save message info as JSON
DOWNLOAD_FOLDER = 'downloads'  # Output folder path
```

## üîß Advanced Usage

### Resume Interrupted Downloads

If download is interrupted, you can resume from a specific message:

```python
RESUME_FROM_MESSAGE_ID = 12345  # Message ID to resume from
```

The script will show the last processed message ID when interrupted.

### Download Specific Number of Messages

To test or limit downloads:

```python
MAX_MESSAGES = 100  # Download only 100 most recent messages
```

### Using Different Channel Identifiers

**For private channels:**
```python
CHANNEL_USERNAME = 3089670048  # Use numeric ID
```

**For public channels:**
```python
CHANNEL_USERNAME = '@channelname'  # Use @username
```

**Using invite links:**
```python
CHANNEL_USERNAME = 'https://t.me/+AbCdEfGhIjK'  # Full invite link
```

## üìä Progress Tracking

The script shows real-time statistics:

```
üìä Statistics:
   Total messages: 150
   Videos: 45
   Photos: 60
   Documents: 30
   Audio: 10
   Skipped: 5
   Errors: 0
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues & Solutions

### "Could not find the input entity"
- Make sure you've **joined the channel** in your Telegram app first
- Verify the channel ID/username is correct
- For private channels, use the numeric ID from `get_channel_id.py`

### "The api_id/api_hash combination is invalid"
- Double-check your credentials from https://my.telegram.org
- `API_ID` should be a number without quotes
- `API_HASH` should be a string with quotes

### "FloodWaitError" or rate limiting
- This is normal - the script automatically waits
- Telegram has rate limits to prevent abuse
- The script will resume automatically after waiting

### Files already exist
- The script skips files that already exist
- Delete the file if you want to re-download it
- Check the "Skipped" count in statistics

### Session expired
- Delete the `session_name.session` file
- Run the script again to re-authenticate
